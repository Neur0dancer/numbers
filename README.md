# numbers
A cheat mode

A cheat code for the numbers part of the famous tv game show number and letters

â€¢ we input the code with a serie of 6 numbers and a result. Then the code finds a way to get to the result (or as near as possible if impossible) with the given numbers.
It then displays how to get to it.

however, my guess is that i'm putting the cart before the horse starting a new "project".
so, i'll let it at that for now and get more used to git with first-go (branching, merging, deleting and so on...)

though, if you happen to pass around and have any idea of path i can explore to achieve this number thing, feel free ;)
